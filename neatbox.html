    			<h2>A future digital experience</h2>
                <p>This time I was challenged by the industry leader, River, to explore and evaluate the mobile landscape, but also to impress and be memorable.</p>
    			<p>Me and my team formed by 5 brilliant people with different education backgrounds, had to face this quite broad brief and resolve it within 2 weeks. So after conceptualizing around the current technologies, the human needs we wanted to solve and the existing services out there, we came up with a concept that will make everyday life easier. Neatbox, a smart storage box, that knows what you put in in and what you take away. Making it easier than ever to keep track of your things.</p>

                <h2>The space you need</h2>
                <p>Clutter is distracting and research confirms that it can actually affect our ability to focus. By putting things to where they belong we are clearing away the visible mess and creating a perfectly clean space for the person we are becoming. That is why we want to launch Neatbox, the space you need to put your things in order by relieving users of the burden of excess and unessential. Neatbox knows exactly what you are storing and help you find what you need at the right time. Including time for yourself. </p>

                <h2>Deep learning</h2>
                <p>We wanted to create a smart box that was accessible for everyone. So, we needed to keep the boxes simple in hardware and make use of the current technology to develop a strong and consistent service. After mapping around this idea we realised that we should base our concept in deep neural networks. This technology allows Neatbox to identify the things that you put in without having to describe them, by just image recognition. <br/><br/></p>

                <h2>Keep track of your things</h2>
                <p>Neatbox will help users find their stuff immediately. Once you get a Neatbox, you are ready to go by just syncing Neatbox with our easy-to-use app via Bluetooth. Neatbox will automatically record its last location, also giving you the option to alert a concrete Neatbox for an easy access and identification. <br/><br/></p>

                <h2>Smart suggestions</h2>
                <p>Pretty strong concept so far, but where's the twist? Neatbox also learns from the things you store and give you personal suggestions according to the weather and history of the item. So the search engine becomes richer and smoother. Just by looking for snow boots, you get suggestions on other items if it's snowing outside and also recommendations to recycle something that has been stored for a long time.<br/><br/></p>

                <h2>Proximity lights</h2>
                <p>Neatbox led lights are designed for two main reasons. Firstly, to make it easy to see what is stored inside of Neatbox and secondly, to identify a specific Neatbox among others. By using our app you can alert a Neatbox that contains the item you're looking for and as soon as you find your things, Neatbox will turn the lights off.</p>
